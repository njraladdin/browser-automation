test without the sekeleton view 
test with image 

being able to see and extract data on a page not just interative elements 




test by extrracintg listings from airbnb / extract list of followers on instagram 



save autoamtion flow 
being able to rerun a step 


-----

fix selecting elements not working on airbnb (simplfy, keep array on backend, use polling in frontend)

----



try another appraoch: 


currenty: extraction isn't working well by writing code to extract data 

selection is not necessary anymore, remove it 

only get interactive elements that are currently visible on the page 

so for automation : provide interactive map of visible elements on the page / source of current sivile elements on the page 
for data extraction : the AI writes a prompt on the data to extract, then it uses a function that calls another gemini request with full source of page (cleaned)
